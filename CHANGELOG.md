# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- **`Dimension::Percent` overflow on windows wider than ~328 px**. `Fixed::div` now promotes through `i64`, so `parent_size * pct / 100` stays correct at any UI size. ESP32-C3 three-body baseline unchanged (~172 fps).
- **`SdlGpuBackend` + `App::run` black screen from the second frame.** `Backend` now reports its backbuffer behaviour via `persistence()`; `App::run` full-redraws every frame on `Transient` backends (swap-chain GPU) and keeps the `render_dirty` fast path on `Persistent` (CPU). Default is `Persistent`, so every existing CPU backend keeps working unchanged.
- **Labels and image blits no longer blur under HiDPI upscale.** `SdlGpuBackend` sets `SDL_RENDER_SCALE_QUALITY=0` at init — textures use nearest-neighbour filtering, which suits mirui's bitmap font and pixel-art assets.

### Added

- **`mirui::backend::BackbufferPersistence`** (`Persistent` / `Transient`) and a `Backend::persistence()` hook (default `Persistent`), used by `App::run` to pick render strategy per backend.
- `examples/sdl_gpu_demo.rs` gets a `DragPlugin` that moves an absolute-positioned box with the mouse — exercises the full `App::run` + plugin + `on_event` path on the GPU backend. The example also prints per-second wall-clock FPS with p50 / p99 / max frame time.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-11

### 🚀 The GPU Backend Release

mirui ships its first non-CPU-raster backend. `SdlGpuBackend` drives the SDL2 accelerated renderer (D3D / OpenGL / Metal, depending on platform) directly: solid fills go straight through `canvas.fill_rect`, complex paths are tessellated with `lyon` and submitted via `SDL_RenderGeometry`, text lives in a per-label `SdlTexture` cache, and textures are `canvas.copy`'d. Behind the new `sdl-gpu` feature; existing `sdl` / `no_std` / default builds are untouched.

On a standard 10 s benchmark scene (30 solid rects + 5 rounded rects with thick borders + 10 labels + 2 blits) on macOS, the GPU backend hits ~160 fps vs the CPU backend's ~119 fps — **~1.33× speedup** with substantially less work on the CPU.

### Added

- **`mirui::backend::sdl_gpu`** module (`sdl-gpu` feature):
  - `SdlGpuBackend` — GPU-backed window, no CPU framebuffer.
  - `SdlGpuFactory` — binds to `SdlGpuBackend` via `impl RendererFactory<SdlGpuBackend>`.
  - `SdlGpuRenderer` — DrawBackend impl covering `Fill` / `Border` / `Line` / `Blit` / `Label` / `Arc` / path fill + stroke through a hybrid fast-path + tessellation strategy.
- **`SdlGpuBackend::new` / `new_with_vsync`** — Vsync-off variant for benchmarking.
- **`SdlBackend::new_with_vsync`** — Same on the CPU backend for consistency.
- **Path tessellation via `lyon` 1.0** (feature-gated): `FillTessellator` / `StrokeTessellator` reuse inside a `TessellationCache`, so complex paths amortise to zero per-frame allocation after warm-up.
- **Per-label GPU texture cache** (keyed by text hash + colour, LRU-bounded to 128 entries) backs the `draw_label` hot path; miss triggers a CPU raster + streaming upload, hits are a single `canvas.copy`.
- **`examples/sdl_gpu_demo.rs`** — visual demo exercising every fast-path.
- **`examples/perf_bench.rs`** — standard scene + 10 s timed run, works against either backend depending on which feature is enabled.
- New optional dependencies (only under `sdl-gpu`): `lyon 1.0`, `lru 0.12`, `sdl2-sys 0.37`.

### Changed

- Lyon fill/stroke tolerance is 1.0 (previous SDL-GPU internal draft used 0.25). Sub-pixel accuracy isn't visible on UI elements; 1.0 buys ~40% tessellation time back.

### Known Issues

- **`SdlGpuBackend` is not compatible with `App::run`** for static scenes. `App::run` drives a dirty-only render after the first frame; SDL's accelerated renderer treats the back buffer as undefined after `present()`, so subsequent frames that draw nothing leave the window blank. Workaround: drive the event loop manually with `app.render()` every frame (see `examples/sdl_gpu_demo.rs`). Planned fix for v0.6.1 is a persistent off-screen target via `with_texture_canvas`.
- **Label text looks soft on HiDPI displays.** Labels are CPU-rasterised at logical size and then GPU-upscaled to physical size for the blit. Readable but not crisp on Retina (scale=2). Planned fix for v0.6.1 is to rasterise labels directly at physical size and cache at that resolution.
- **`Dimension::Percent` is buggy at large parent sizes.** `parent_size * pct / 100` overflows the `Fixed` 24.8 pipeline once the physical width goes above ~500 px; the resulting widget rect is nonsensical (negative w/h) and everything clips away. All the bundled examples use `Dimension::px(...)` to sidestep this. Planned fix is a proper `Fixed::mul_div` that promotes to i64 internally; targeted for v0.6.1.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-05-10

### 🧱 Trait Architecture Refactor (GPU-Ready Prep)

Groundwork for v0.6.0's SDL GPU backend — `Backend` no longer assumes a CPU framebuffer, and `RendererFactory` is parameterised over the backend type so GPU backends can reach into backend-specific resources (Canvas / device / context). CPU backends implement a new `FramebufferAccess` sub-trait. ESP32-C3 three-body holds at ~5.5-6.0 ms/frame — no regression.

### Added

- **`FramebufferAccess: Backend`** sub-trait (`mirui::backend`) — CPU-raster backends implement it and return `Texture<'_>` (metadata + buffer bundled). Consumed by `SwDrawBackendFactory` via blanket impl. GPU-only backends (future SDL GPU / wgpu / VG-Lite) skip it.

### Changed (⚠️ Breaking)

- **`Backend::framebuffer() -> &mut [u8]` removed**. CPU backends now implement `FramebufferAccess::framebuffer() -> Texture<'_>` instead. The bundled `SdlBackend` and `FramebufBackend` have migrated. Custom CPU backends need to split `impl Backend + impl FramebufferAccess`.
- **`RendererFactory` gains a `<B: Backend>` generic parameter**: `fn make(&mut self, backend: &mut B, transform: &CoordTransform)`. `SwDrawBackendFactory` now provides a `impl<B: FramebufferAccess> RendererFactory<B>` blanket, so any CPU backend "just works" with the default factory. GPU factories bind to their concrete `B` (e.g. `impl RendererFactory<SdlGpuBackend> for SdlGpuFactory`).
- **`Plugin<B, F>` bound tightened** to `F: RendererFactory<B>`. Custom plugin impls need one extra where clause: `where B: Backend, F: RendererFactory<B>`.
- **`App::new(backend)` requires `B: FramebufferAccess`** (only the default `SwDrawBackendFactory` needs CPU buffer access). `App::with_factory` remains open to any `B: Backend` + `F: RendererFactory<B>`.
- Generic demo fns on `mirui-examples` that used `App<impl Backend>` need to switch to `App<impl FramebufferAccess>` (same change any downstream CPU app will face).

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-10

### 🧹 CoordTransform Follow-up

Finishes what 0.5.0 started — the `RendererFactory::make` signature still took a raw `Fixed` scale, and the event loop rebuilt a transform per event. Both gone. ESP32-C3 three-body demo holds at ~5.5-6.0 ms/frame (≈173 fps) on-device, matching the 0.5.0 baseline.

### Changed (⚠️ Breaking)

- **`RendererFactory::make(tex, scale: Fixed)` → `make(tex, transform: &CoordTransform)`**. Anyone implementing a custom `RendererFactory` (including `compose_backend!` factories) grabs `scale` via `transform.scale()`. Default `SwDrawBackendFactory` handled internally.

### Changed

- `CoordTransform` hot methods marked `#[inline]` (`scale`, `logical_size`, `physical_size`, `point_to_physical`, `rect_to_physical`, `rect_to_physical_pixel_bounds`, `point_to_logical`, `new`) plus `DisplayInfo::transform`. Release LTO already inlined most of them; the annotation pins the contract.
- `App::run` event-drain loop now snapshots `logical_size` once per iteration instead of reconstructing the transform per input event. Every event in a drain sees the same logical size — single source of truth.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-10

### 🗺️ The CoordTransform Release

Logical ↔ physical pixel conversion now lives in one type. The render pipeline used to carry `(screen_w, screen_h, scale)` triples around and inline `Fixed::from(w) / scale` divisions; every one of those collapses into a single `&CoordTransform` parameter.

### Added

- **`mirui::types::CoordTransform`** — holds physical size + scale, offers `logical_size()`, `point_to_physical()`, `rect_to_physical()`, `rect_to_physical_pixel_bounds()`, `point_to_logical()`. Constructor normalises `scale <= 0` to `1` so downstream consumers stop duplicating the guard.
- **`DisplayInfo::transform()`** — one-liner builder for the transform.

### Changed (⚠️ Breaking)

- `render_system::{render, render_region, update_layout, collect_dirty_region}` now take `transform: &CoordTransform` in place of `(screen_w: u16, screen_h: u16, scale: Fixed)`. Callers writing their own render loop need to switch to `CoordTransform::new(width, height, scale)` or `info.transform()`. `App::run` users are unaffected.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-10

### 🧩 The Plugin Release

`App` now accepts **plugins** — self-contained bundles of systems, resources, and lifecycle hooks. The previous contract of "subclass the run loop to get per-frame timing" is dead: `app.add_plugin(StdInstantClockPlugin).add_plugin(FpsSummaryPlugin).run()` is the whole story. The ESP32-C3 three-body demo still holds ~160 fps through the new path.

### Added

- **`Plugin<B, F>` trait** in `mirui::plugin`, with five methods:
  - `build(&mut self, app: &mut App<B, F>)` — one-shot registration
  - `pre_render(&mut self, world)` / `post_render(&mut self, world, render_nanos)` — per-frame hooks
  - `on_event(&mut self, world, event) -> bool` — intercept input, `true` consumes
  - `on_quit(&mut self, world)` — cleanup before `App::run` returns
  - blanket impl for `FnMut(&mut App<B, F>)` so a closure is already a plugin
- **`App::add_plugin<P>(p) -> &mut Self`** — registers a plugin, runs its `build`, stores the instance for later hooks. Chains with `add_system`.
- **`App::clock: ClockFn`** — monotonic clock providing the nanoseconds passed to `post_render`. Default `|| 0`; plugins swap it in `build`.
- **`mirui::plugins` module** with two built-ins:
  - `StdInstantClockPlugin` (gated on the new `std` feature) — `std::time::Instant`-backed clock
  - `FpsSummaryPlugin` — accumulates `render_nanos` over a frame bucket (default 60) and emits an "avg render" line; `with_sink` lets the sink be overridden for bare-metal targets
- **`std` feature flag** (implied by `sdl`). `no_std` + `alloc` remains the default build; anything in `mirui::plugins::std_clock` or other std-only items sits behind this feature.

### Changed

- **`App` gains a generic + field for plugin storage**: the run loop now dispatches `pre_render` / `post_render` / `on_event` / `on_quit` around the existing rendering and event code. Apps that never call `add_plugin` see empty vector iteration — identical to the previous behaviour in practice.
- `add_system` now returns `&mut Self` to chain with `add_plugin`.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- **`compose_backend!` macro** (`mirui-macros`) — build a hybrid `DrawBackend` by routing each method to a chosen field:
  ```rust
  compose_backend! {
      pub struct Hybrid {
          sw: SwDrawBackend,
          gpu: GpuBackend,
      }
      route {
          default => sw,
          blit => gpu,
          clear => gpu,
      }
  }
  ```
  Generated struct is generic over one type parameter per field, implements both `DrawBackend` and `Renderer`, and routes through the chosen field at compile time (no runtime dispatch). Unrouted methods fall back to the `default` field; unrouted default-impl methods (`fill_rect` / `stroke_rect` / `draw_line` / `draw_arc`) fall through to the `DrawBackend` trait default.
- **`RendererFactory` trait** (`mirui::app`) + **`SwDrawBackendFactory`** — let `App` build a fresh `Renderer` each frame from the framebuffer instead of hard-coding `SwDrawBackend`. `App::with_factory(backend, factory)` is the new explicit constructor; `App::new(backend)` keeps the default behaviour.
- **`App` is now generic over the factory** (`App<B, F = SwDrawBackendFactory>`). Existing `App::new(backend)` call sites compile unchanged.
- Diagnostic Levenshtein "did you mean" hints for unknown method / field names in `compose_backend!` routes.
- Two SDL examples exercising `compose_backend!`:
  - `compose_backend_demo` — direct `DrawBackend` usage with a `Logging` wrapper
  - `compose_backend_dsl` — full `ui!` + ECS + `App::with_factory` pipeline, drifting images routed through the logging field

### Changed

- `App<B>` type signature becomes `App<B, F = SwDrawBackendFactory>`. Default value means `App::new(backend)` stays source-compatible; callers that spelled out the type (e.g. `fn use_app(app: &mut App<SdlBackend>)`) continue to work via the default too. Generic bounds that added `where` clauses on `App<B>` specifically are unaffected.
- Painter now forwards every DrawBackend primitive (`draw_text` / `fill_path` / `stroke_path` / `draw_line` / `draw_arc` in addition to the earlier four).

### Fixed

- `stroke_path`: reversed the outer ring winding so the even-odd fill rule correctly carves `outer_area ∖ inner_area`. Stroked triangles and rectangles now render as continuous outlines instead of the broken-up look the earlier winding produced.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-10

### 🎨 The DrawBackend Release

`DrawBackend` is now a real rendering surface. `fill_path` and `stroke_path` actually work (with scanline coverage anti-aliasing), `draw_line` / `draw_arc` exist, and `rounded_rect` corners are actually round. The ESP32-C3 three-body demo holds 160 fps with correct corner AA that used to silently skip; new shapes and butterfly demos render vector graphics at 30-35 fps.

### Added

- **`Path::bbox()`** — conservative bounding box including Bezier control points
- **`Path::arc(center, radius, start, end)`** — builds an arc path using cubic Bezier segments (≤90° each, `k = 4/3 · tan(θ/4)`). Angles in degrees, CCW
- **`Fixed::sin_deg` / `Fixed::cos_deg`** — Taylor 6-term approximation, error < 0.01
- **`Fixed::{MAX, MIN, PI}`** constants + **`Point::ZERO`** constant
- **`fill_path`** on `SwDrawBackend` — scanline rasterizer with 4 sub-scanlines per row, even-odd fill, Fixed-space coverage integration. Diagonal edges render cleanly without combing
- **`stroke_path`** on `SwDrawBackend` — offset polygon with miter join (miter_limit = 4, bevel fallback), butt caps for open paths. Outer ring winding is reversed relative to inner so even-odd carves `outer ∖ inner` correctly
- **`DrawBackend::draw_line`** / **`draw_arc`** — trait default implementations routing through `stroke_path`
- `DrawCommand::Line` / `Arc` are now handled by `Renderer::draw` (previously silently dropped)
- `rounded_rect` corners now use cubic Bezier (`k = 4/3 · tan(22.5°) ≈ 0.5523`), reducing arc approximation error from ~27% of radius to ~0.03%
- Visual snapshot tests under `tests/visual_fill_path.rs` (`#[ignore]`-gated, manual run via `cargo test -- --ignored`)

### Fixed

- **`Fixed::sqrt`** — previously returned `sqrt(raw)` instead of `sqrt(raw << 8)`, off by a factor of 16 in Fixed space. `rounded_rect_coverage` was accidentally masking it because the buggy `dist - r` value always exceeded 1 and took the "no AA" branch. Corner anti-aliasing now actually functions

### Changed (⚠️ Breaking)

- **`DrawBackend` trait** gained `draw_label(&mut self, pos, text, clip, color, opa)` as a required method. Previously `draw_label` was only defined on `SwDrawBackend` directly. External implementers of `DrawBackend` must now provide a `draw_label` implementation; there is no default
- **`DrawCommand::Line` / `Arc`** fields migrated from `u16` to `Fixed` (`width`, `radius`, `start_angle`, `end_angle`), aligning with the rest of the pipeline. No known external emitters

### Performance

- ESP32-C3 three-body demo: 170 → 160 fps (-6%). The regression is a direct consequence of the `Fixed::sqrt` fix: `rounded_rect_coverage` now actually performs the per-edge AA ramp it was designed to, instead of silently taking the short-circuit branch
- New scanline rasterizer is substantially faster than the previous "per-pixel distance + sqrt" approach: shapes demo 1 fps → 35 fps (small circle) after introducing Chebyshev AABB rejection + coverage integration

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-09

### 🎉 The Subpixel Release

mirui now renders with **24.8 fixed-point precision** across the entire pipeline — from layout to rendering to event handling. Every coordinate, every rect, every scroll offset lives in subpixel space. Anti-aliased edges come for free. And somehow, the binary got **11% smaller**.

### Added

- **`Fixed` type** — 24.8 fixed-point arithmetic with `Add`/`Sub`/`Mul`/`Div`/`Neg`, `ceil()`/`floor()`/`round()`/`sqrt()`/`abs()`, `From<i32>`/`From<u16>`/`From<u32>`/`From<f32>`
- **`Dimension` enum** — `Px(Fixed)` / `Percent(Fixed)` / `Auto` / `Content` with `resolve(parent_size)` and arithmetic ops
- **Subpixel anti-aliased rendering** — rect edges and rounded corners use coverage-based alpha blending
- **`rounded_rect_coverage()`** — replaces boolean hit test with smooth 1px falloff
- **Fast path** — integer-aligned rects with no radius skip coverage calculation entirely (zero overhead)
- **`Rect::new(x, y, w, h)`** — accepts `impl Into<Fixed>`, write `Rect::new(0, 0, 480, 320)` directly
- **`Fixed::is_integer()`** / **`Rect::is_aligned()`** — query alignment without touching raw bits
- **`Dimension::px()`** / **`Dimension::percent()`** — const constructors
- **`set_position(world, entity, x, y)`** — now accepts `impl Into<Fixed>`, pass integers or Fixed seamlessly
- **xrune-fmt CI integration** — `cargo xtask ci` checks DSL formatting

### Changed (⚠️ Breaking)

- `Rect` fields: `i32`/`u16` → `Fixed`
- `Point` fields: `i32` → `Fixed`
- `LayoutStyle.width/height/left/top`: `Option<u16>`/`Option<i32>` → `Dimension`
- `LayoutStyle.grow`: `f32` → `Fixed`
- `LayoutStyle.padding`: `u16` → `Dimension`
- `InputEvent::Touch/TouchMove/Release` coordinates: `i32` → `Fixed`
- `ScrollOffset` fields: `i32` → `Fixed`
- `DisplayInfo.scale`: `u16` → `Fixed` (now supports fractional scales like 1.5x)
- `Style.border_width/border_radius`: `u16` → `Fixed`
- `ScrollConfig.content_height/content_width`: `u16` → `Fixed`
- `compute_layout()` signature: all params now `Fixed`
- `app.run()` now uses `render_dirty()` instead of full `render()` per frame

### Performance

- ESP32-C3 binary size: **42,740B → 37,976B (-11%)** — eliminated soft-float `__mulsf3`/`__divsf3`
- Zero-cost for integer-aligned widgets (fast path bypasses coverage math)
- RISC-V disassembly confirms: `Dimension::resolve()` fully inlined, Fixed mul = single `mul` instruction
